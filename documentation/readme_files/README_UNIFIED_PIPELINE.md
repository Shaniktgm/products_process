# Complete Product Pipeline - A-Z

This is the unified, comprehensive pipeline that handles all product data processing from start to finish.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
python3 complete_product_pipeline.py
```

## 📋 What It Does

The pipeline performs the following steps automatically:

### Step 1: Process Affiliate Links
- Reads `products/product_affilate_links.csv`
- Extracts Amazon product IDs from URLs
- Creates products in the database
- Generates pretty referral links with `homeprinciple` tag
- Populates `affiliation_details` table

### Step 2: Extract Product Details
- Scrapes Amazon product pages for detailed information
- Extracts: title, price, rating, review count, description, brand, material, color, size
- Downloads product images to local `images/products/` folder
- Updates `product_images` table with image URLs and local paths

### Step 3: Generate Enhanced Pros and Cons
- Creates dynamic, product-specific pros and cons
- Analyzes product characteristics (material, features, price, etc.)
- Generates contextual advantages and disadvantages

### Step 4: Generate Product Summaries
- Creates Martha Stewart-style elegant product summaries
- Uses sophisticated language and descriptive phrases
- Focuses on quality, comfort, and lifestyle benefits

### Step 5: Calculate Product Scores

- Updates all scoring fields in the database
